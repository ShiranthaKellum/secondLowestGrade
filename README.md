# secondLowestGrade
There is a PYTHON code

Given the names and grades for each student in a class of 'N' students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.

Note: If there are multiple students with the second lowest grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.

Ex : _name_ | _grade_
       c    |   3.2
       b    |   2.1
       a    |   3.2
       d    |   3.9
       e    |   2.1
       
       second lowest mark is 3.2
       So output should be
       
                          a
                          c
